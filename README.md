# üì∂ Wavecon Telecom Analysis ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard Project

This project was completed as part of the **CodeBasics Virtual Internship Program** in the telecom domain. I analyzed key performance indicators (KPIs) before and after the **5G launch** for a fictional telecom company called **Wavecon Telecom**.

Using **Power BI**, I provided business insights and strategic recommendations based on customer churn, revenue trends, plan usage, and market share.
